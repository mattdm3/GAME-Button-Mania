# BUTTON MANIA

## The Story 

This was one of the first games I had to build during my web development bootcamp. It's totally built and styled with Javascript. 

### Instructions

- When the user clicks "Start Game" a random amount of buttons will appear and a 5 second timer will begin. 
- The user must click all the buttons before the end of the timer.
